## Business Problem Statement Understanding
### Problem statement
Client wants us to analyzing their dataset is to get a fair idea about the

what are thoes factors which are actully affecting the aggregate rating of each restaurant?

Which are the causes that can occure while establishing a different types of restaurant at different places?

Bengaluru being one such city has more than 12,000 restaurants with restaurants serving dishes from all over the world.

With each day new restaurants opening the industry has'nt been saturated yet and the demand is increasing day by day.

Inspite of increasing demand it however has become difficult for new restaurants to compete with established restaurants. Most of them serving the same food.

Bengaluru being an IT capital of India. Most of the people here are dependent mainly on the restaurant food as they don't have time to cook for themselves.

With such an overwhelming demand of restaurants it has therefore become important to study the demography of a location.

What kind of a food is more popular in a locality?

Do the entire locality loves vegetarian food? If yes, then Is that locality populated by a particular sect of people for eg. Jain, Marwaris, Gujaratis who are mostly vegetarian?

These kind of analysis can be done using the data, by studying different factors.

why do they need you as a data scientist?
Our client need a data scientist, who could help them to take a informative and firm decision based on the Zomato dataset to open a restaurant based on the competitive analysis and visualize of the data, and exploratory data analysis. Proper extraction of data & information from the unorganized and large dataset could help the organisation to make informed, meaningful decision, leaverage new business oportunites and extract the new insights from existing data, and achieve upper hand from competitors in terms of bussiness.
